Chain Replication

This project aims to implement chain replication, as described in

  [vRS2004chain] Robbert van Renesse and Fred B. Schneider.  Chain
  Replication for Supporting High Throughput and Availability.  In
  Proceedings of the 6th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and
  Implementation (OSDI), pages 91-104.  USENIX Association, 2004.

Also, design and implement an extension to handle an operation that
involves multiple chains, as described below.

Chain replication is also described in

  [vrG2010replication] Robbert van Renesse and Rachid Guerraoui.
  Replication Techniques for Availability. In Replication: Theory and
  Practise, Bernadette Charron-Bost, Fernando Pedone, and Andre Schiper,
  editors, volume 5959 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 19-40.
