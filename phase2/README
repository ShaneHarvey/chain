PHASE 2: NON-FAULT-TOLERANT SERVICE

in both languages, implement and test the clients and servers, except do
not implement algorithms to cope with failures, extend the chain, or
support transfers.  thus, clients issue requests, and servers handle them
appropriately (forwarding updates along the chain, etc.), provided no
failures occur.
